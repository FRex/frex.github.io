<h1>FRex Lua Blog</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Lua blog, about Lua, in Lua.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>
I've learned Lua 5.2 back in early 2010s, because it was the most recent
version at the time. Later I downgraded to 5.1, since its features were good
enough and 5.1 is the version implemented by LuaJIT, but I usually use and
deeply explore the stock PUC Lua 5.1 these days.
<p>
<p>
Since May 2023 I started to use Lua again, for scripting, data and dialogues
in my C++ game (not yet released) which inspired me to start this blog.
The posts on this blog are generated by my own pure Lua script,
including a partial implementation of Markdown in pure Lua.
</p>
<p><strong>This blog is NOT affiliated with LuaJIT, PUC, Tecgraf, lua.org or anyone!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very WIP, check back soon.</strong></p>
